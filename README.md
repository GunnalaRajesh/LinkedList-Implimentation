**LinkedLists in Java**
This repository contains Java implementations of Singly Linked List and Doubly Linked List along with accompanying note points for a better understanding of the concepts.

Contents:
SinglyLinkedList.java:
Implementation of a basic Singly Linked List with operations such as insertion, deletion, and traversal.

DoublyLinkedList.java:
Implementation of a Doubly Linked List with operations such as insertion, deletion, and traversal. It includes doubly linked nodes for improved functionality.

LinkedListNotes.md:
Comprehensive notes explaining the theory behind Singly and Doubly Linked Lists. These notes cover basic operations, time complexity analysis, and common use cases.

Usage:
Feel free to use these implementations as a reference for understanding and implementing linked lists in Java. The accompanying notes provide detailed insights into the concepts and operations.
